# Zilgraph - A Zilswap Dashboard
Zilgraph is an open source tool for visualizing Zilswap activity on the Zilliqa blockchain. It provides token OHLC charts - daily and hourly, liquitidy distribution and more.

Zilgraph is launched here:  [Zilgraph](http://zilgraph.ddns.net)

The data is acquired from the zilswap smart contract and stored in a local MongoDB database.

The Zilgraph front-end provides visualized data using bokeh python library.

# Dependencies

Add Elasticsearch repository, install and start:

    wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
    echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install elasticsearch kibana
    sudo service elasticsearch start
    sudo service kibana start
    
Zilgraph package dependencies:

    sudo apt install libgmp-dev mongodb

The Zilgraph python dependencies can be install using the following command:

    pip3 install pyzil pymongo urllib3 requests pandas numpy bokeh elasticsearch

# Zilcrawler

The Zilcrawler is a crawler collecting and processing all the data required for the charts presented on Zilgraph. It is interfacing the zilswap smart contract through pyzil API as well as the viewblock API. For the latter we need an API-KEY which can be acquired from viewblock for free after registration. (see https://viewblock.io/api)

Once obtained, the API-KEY need to be stored in your home folder in ~/.viewblock.json with the following format:

    {
        "X-APIKEY": {
            "key"    : "<key_string>",
            "secret" : "<secret_string>"
        }
    }

Finally, you can start the crawler:

    ~/zilgraph/dash$ python3 crawler.py 

# Start Dashboard

The dashboard is described in *main.py* and makes use of the python bokeh library. The default deployment uses port 5006 on your localhost.

For development purpose you can use the bokeh server to launch the website at http://localhost:5006

    ~/zilgraph$ bokeh serve --dev --show dash


For deployment in the production environment it is recommended using an nginx reverse proxy in front of the bokeh server. Start the bokeh server for zilgraph production environment with:

    ~/zilgraph$ bokeh serve --show dash --allow-websocket-origin="zilgraph.ddns.net"


For the nginx config one can use:

    ~$ cat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default 
    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5006;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header Host $host:$server_port;
            proxy_buffering off;
        }
    }



# Further Work

Community contribution to the project is highly appreciated. If you like to contribute but don't know where to start you could go with one of the open points below.

- [x] Zilswap Dashboard for XSGD, gZIL, BOLT, ZLP and others
- [x] Daily and hourly OHLC charts for all tokens with historic data back to zilswap contract creation
- [x] Current Liquidity distribution and total liquidity
- [x] Current rates and liquidity of the tokens
- [x] Basic zilswap python library (Get current market data, issue ExactZILforToken/TokenForExactZIL smart contract call)
    
- [ ] Make Zilgraph viewed better on mobile devices
- [ ] Full-featured python zilswap library
- [ ] Visualization of historic liquidity depth
- [ ] Adding trading volume to price chart
- [ ] Use local Zilliqa node as data provider for the Zilcrawler (Do we need a seed node for that?)
- [ ] Visualization of other commonly used Zilliqa smart contracts (e.g. Staking Contract, Unstoppable Domains)
